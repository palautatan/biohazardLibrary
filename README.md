# biohazardCleanUp R library
In this library, I will include R function versions of my biohazardCleanUp functions. It will be maintained as I progress through projects at the Moore Lab at UC Davis. The functions I will write are functions that I need for my research, and I hope that they may also be useful to you.

If you have questions, forward them to ehespejo@ucdavis.edu
